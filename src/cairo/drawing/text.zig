//! text â€” Rendering text and glyphs
//!
//! The functions with *text* in their name form cairo's *toy* text API. The
//! toy API takes UTF-8 encoded text and is limited in its functionality to
//! rendering simple left-to-right text with no advanced features. That means
//! for example that most complex scripts like Hebrew, Arabic, and Indic
//! scripts are out of question. No kerning or correct positioning of
//! diacritical marks either. The font selection is pretty limited too and
//! doesn't handle the case that the selected font does not cover the
//! characters in the text. This set of functions are really that, a toy text
//! API, for testing and demonstration purposes. Any serious application should
//! avoid them.
//!
//! The functions with *glyphs* in their name form cairo's *low-level* text
//! API. The low-level API relies on the user to convert text to a set of glyph
//! indexes and positions. This is a very hard problem and is best handled by
//! external libraries, like the pangocairo that is part of the Pango text
//! layout and rendering library. Pango is available from http://www.pango.org/
