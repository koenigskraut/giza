//! `cairo.Pattern` â€” Sources for drawing
//!
//! `cairo.Pattern` is the paint with which cairo draws. The primary use of
//! patterns is as the source for all cairo drawing operations, although they
//! can also be used as masks, that is, as the brush too.
//!
//! A cairo pattern is created by using one of the many constructors, of the
//! form `cairo.Pattern.create*Type*()` or implicitly through
//! `ctx.setSource*Type*()` functions.
//!

/// `meshPattern.setCornerColorRGB()` or `meshPattern.setCornerColorRGBA()`.
/// Any corner whose color is not explicitly specified defaults to transparent
/// black.
///
/// A Coons patch is a special case of the tensor-product patch where the
/// control points are implicitly defined by the sides of the patch. The
/// default value for any control point not specified is the implicit value for
/// a Coons patch, i.e. if no control points are specified the patch is a Coons
/// patch.
///

/// points are implicitly defined by the sides of the patch, all the sides are
/// lines and one of them has length 0, i.e. if the patch is specified using
/// just 3 lines, it is a triangle. If the corners connected by the 0-length
/// side have the same color, the patch is a Gouraud-shaded triangle.
///
/// Patches may be oriented differently to the above diagram. For example the
/// first point could be at the top left. The diagram only shows the
/// relationship between the sides, corners and control points. Regardless of
/// where the first point is located, when specifying colors, corner 0 will
/// always be the first point, corner 1 the point between side 0 and side 1
/// etc.
///
/// Calling `meshPattern.endPatch()` completes the current patch. If less than
/// 4 sides have been defined, the first missing side is defined as a line from
/// the current point to the first point of the patch (C0) and the other sides
/// are degenerate lines from C0 to C0. The corners between the added sides
/// will all be coincident with C0 of the patch and their color will be set to
/// be the same as the color of C0.
///
/// Additional patches may be added with additional calls to
/// `meshPattern.beginPatch()`/`meshPattern.endPatch().
