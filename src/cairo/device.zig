//! `cairo.Device` â€” interface to underlying rendering system
//!
//! Devices are the abstraction Cairo employs for the rendering system used by
//! a `cairo.Surface`. You can get the device of a surface using
//! `surface.getDevice()`.
//!
//! Devices are created using custom functions specific to the rendering system
//! you want to use. See the documentation for the surface types for those
//! functions.
//!
//! An important function that devices fulfill is sharing access to the
//! rendering system between Cairo and your application. If you want to access
//! a device directly that you used to draw to with Cairo, you must first call
//! `device.flush()` to ensure that Cairo finishes all operations on the device
//! and resets it to a clean state.
//!
//! Cairo also provides the functions `device.acquire()` and `device.release()`
//! to synchronize access to the rendering system in a multithreaded
//! environment. This is done internally, but can also be used by applications.
//!
//! Putting this all together, a function that works with devices should look
//! something like this:
//! ```zig
//! fn myDeviceModifyintFunction(device: *cairo.Device) void {
//!     // Ensure the device is properly reset
//!     device.flush();
//!     // Try to acquire the device
//!     device.acquire() catch |e| {
//!         std.debug.print("Failed to acquire the device: {any}\n", .{e});
//!         return;
//!     };
//!
//!     // Do the custom operations on the device here.
//!     // But do not call any Cairo functions that might acquire devices.
//!
//!     // Release the device when done.
//!     device.release();
//! }
//! ```
//! >Please refer to the documentation of each backend for additional usage
//! requirements, guarantees provided, and interactions with existing surface
//! API of the device functions for surfaces of that type.
