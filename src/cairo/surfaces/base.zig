//! `cairo.Surface` â€” Base class for surfaces
//! `cairo.Surface` is the abstract type representing all different drawing
//! targets that cairo can render to. The actual drawings are performed using a
//! cairo *context*.
//!
//! A cairo surface is created by using *backend*-specific constructors,
//! typically of the form `*backend*Surface.create()`.
//!
//! Most surface types allow accessing the surface without using Cairo
//! functions. If you do this, keep in mind that it is mandatory that you call
//! `surface.flush()` before reading from or writing to the surface and that
//! you must use `surface.markDirty()` after modifying it.
//!
//! **Example 1. Directly modifying an image surface**
//! ```zig
//! fn modifyImageSurface(surface: *cairo.ImageSurface) !void {
//!     // flush to ensure all writing to the image was done
//!     surface.flush();
//!
//!     // modify the image
//!     var data: [*]u8 = try surface.getData();
//!     const width = surface.getWidth();
//!     const height = surface.getHeight();
//!     const stride = surface.getStride();
//!     modifyImageData(data, width, height, stride);
//!
//!     // mark the image dirty so Cairo clears its caches.
//!     surface.markDirty();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that for other surface types it might be necessary to acquire the
//! surface's device first. See `cairo.Device.aquire()` for a discussion of
//! devices.
